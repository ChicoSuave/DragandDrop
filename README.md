# My Favorite Game

This app has a splash screen with a back ground image of the Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversay with the original N64 Zelda game score. 

The main screen has a gridview that allows the user to choose a game throughout the Zelda series by its picture. When the picture is clicked the main OST will play from that pic. There is also a start, pause and start event.
